## 2.1 Writing a Simple Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    printf("To C, or not to C: thats is the question.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

-`#include <stdio.h>`: Indicates inclution of the `standard I/O` library, a package/collection of helpful tools/functions.

- `printf`: A function that prints formatted text to the terminal window, found within the 
`standard I/O` library.
    -`\n`: A *escape character* to indicate the cursor to move to a new line within the `printf` call.

- `return 0;`: Indicates that the program "returns" the value 0 to the operating system when it terminates.

- Steps to convert **program.c* to a form that the machine can read and execute:
    1. **Preprocessing**: TThe program is first given to a **preprocessor**, which obeys commands that begin with **# (known as directives)**. A preprocessor is a bit like an editor; it can add things to the program and make modifications.
        -The preprocessor is usually integrated with the **compiler**
    2. **Compiling**: The modified program now goes to a compiler, which translates it into **machine instructions (object code)**. The program isn’t quite ready to run yet, however.
    3. **Linking**: In the final step, a linker combines the object code produced by the compiler with any additional code needed to yield a complete executable program. This additional code includes **library functions (like printf)** that are used in the program.
